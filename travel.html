      <p>I spent a lot of time traveling over the last 15 years, including living in Korea for three years.

      <p>I also got to spend time traveling on my own, including travel to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thailand</li>
        <li>Bangladesh</li>
        <li>India</li>
        <li>Nepal</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Later Years</h3>
    <p>Since finishing up and leaving Korea, I was fortunate to find a job in the US that included global travel. This includes travel to conferences and meetings for groups such as <a href="www.inshpo.org">INSHPO</a> in places like:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li>Turkey</li>
